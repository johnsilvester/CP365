My group for our Scrabble bot project was Moonshot. Our original goal was to create a bot that would learn from a dataset via unsupervised learning. After having issues finding a data set that would work well enough, we decided to change paths. Our new goal was to create a helper function for the generic scrabble bot. The helper function would take in the board state and our botâ€™s current rack and attempt to add weights or emphasize a potential move based on available board positions. We planned to use a convolutional Neural Network to accomplish this task.

During the process all of the Moonshot team had rapidly changing tasks. My first task was finding a way to scrape the dataset from an online professional scrabble game tracking site. Once this was accomplished, I worked with Fei on creating a way for the neural network to learn from the available dataset. From this point, our team decided to pursue the convolutional neural network, forgoing our original goal of a standalone bot. Our work was then split up again and Callum and I were in charge of creating the neural network, while the rest of the team attempted to parse the difficult data. Unfortunately, time ran out before we were able to successfully parse the data due to our data only showing the first position of the move, therefore we could not tell the direction of the move. We came extremely close to being able to train the heuristic but
